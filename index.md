My name is Effrosyni, or Ersi for short. I am a PhD student at the signal processing laboratory <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lts4/" target="_blank">LTS4</a> in <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/en/" target="_blank">EPFL</a>. My research is focused on Machine Learning for structured data. I am particularly interested in exploiting Optimal Transport for the development of representation learning algorithms for graphs.

Before moving to Switzerland, I lived in London for two years. From 2013-2014 I was a student at <a href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk" target="_blank">Imperial College</a> and I obtained an MSc on Communications and Signal Processing from the Electrical Engineering Department. After my MSc graduation, I stayed at Imperial College, to work as a Research Assistant at the <a href="https://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk" target="_blank">IBUG</a> lab at the Computing Department. 

I received my Diploma degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from the <a href="https://www.ntua.gr/en/" target="_blank">National Technical University of Athens</a> in 2013.
